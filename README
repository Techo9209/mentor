Mentor is a desktop flashcard application used as learning aid tool.

It lets you manage and review sets of flashcards, which are separate pieces of useful
information, like foreign vocabulary, program commands, or other facts. 

In order to memorize those facts, you need to review the flashcards at regular intervals. 
Mentor optimizes this process by calculating optimum intervals, so that you
spend minimal time at reviewing your memorized cards.


You can create your own flashcard sets or use other people' cards.  There are
many already prepared flashcard sets on the Net which you can download and use
freely. 


Creation of flashcards is done manually and, although educational, can be quite
time-consuming. To quicked this process, Mentor also includes a tool called
Probe which automates extracting of facts from text and html documents.
